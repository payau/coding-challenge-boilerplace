# Bonus Front-end Coding Challenge

## The Why

As the main coding challenge is all back-end work, we understand that it would isolate developers whose strengths are in front-end development. As such this coding challenge is added to give those developers a chance to show us their front-end skills. Of course, this bonus challenge welcomes all who would like to show off their front-end skills, and is completely optional.

At Pay, all our front-end applications are built with React. As such, this front-end coding challenge is designed to test your core React skills. These include but are not limited to:

1. State management
2. Fetching asynchronous data
3. Client-side routing

## The What

The challenge is an extension to the main coding challenge and involves you adding functionality to the existing Admin Dashboard. You will be provided with a boilerplate React project for the Admin Dashboard and need to integrate the Admin Dashboard with the back-end work you've done. Again, we are assessing your core React skills and not your ability to style with CSS. Please refrain from changing or adding to the CSS.

## The How

Your tasks for this challenge include:

1. Displaying the bank's total amount in the navigation bar and on the main Admin Dashboard homepage
2. Displaying all bank accounts in the bank on the main Admin Dashboard homepage
3. Displaying a user's details and his/her bank account details on a separate page
4. Add ability to go back to homepage when the logo is clicked
5. Write automated tests
6. Write a short explanation of your approach to the above requirements and how to run the automated tests

In order for the React application to integrate with your back-end, you will need to create an interface to interact with, e.g., RESTful endpoints. However, this challenge is not testing your skills on creating RESTful endpoints so please keep the interface simple as we won't be assessing it.

## Do

1. Show off your front-end React skills
2. Use existing components provided
3. Have fun!

## Do not

1. Modify the CSS
2. Install unnecessary NPM packages
3. Add functionalities not outlined in [The How](#the-how)
